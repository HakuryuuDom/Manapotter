# ManaPotter  
A tera-proxy module that automatically uses a Prime Replenishment Potable when below 50% MP.  
Waits 30 seconds after reviving before the check starts again.  
Upon login, if you are a Slayer or Berserker, the script is disabled by default. For any other class it is enabled by default.  
  
## Usage  
While in game, open a whisper chat session with "!Manapotter" by typing "/w !manapotter" in chat and hitting the space bar.
This serves as the script's command interface. 
The following commands are supported:  
  
* on - Enables the script  
* off - Disables the script  
  
Any other input returns a summary of above commands in the game.
  
## Safety
Whatever you send to "!Manapotter" in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.
