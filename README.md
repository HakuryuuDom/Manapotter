# Manapotter  
A tera-proxy module that automatically uses a Prime Replenishment Potable when below 50% MP.  
Only uses items when you are alive and in combat.  
  
## Usage  
While in game, open a whisper chat session with "!Manapotter" by typing "/w !manapotter" in chat and hitting the space bar.
This serves as the script's command interface. 
The following commands are supported:  
  
* on - Enables the script  
* off - Disables the script  
  
Any other input returns a summary of above commands in the game.  
  
Alternative commands in all other chats:  
* !mpots - Toggles between "on" and "off" state  
  
## Safety
Whatever you send to "!Manapotter" in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.
